# Event Loops and Timers

# Event Loops

JavaScript has a concurrency model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java.

## Runtime concepts

![Runtime concept](../javascript/The_Javascript_Runtime_Environment_Example.svg)

### Stack

Function calls form a stack of frames.

```js
function foo(b) {
  let a = 10
  return a + b + 11
}

function bar(x) {
  let y = 3
  return foo(x * y)
}

console.log(bar(7)) //returns 42
```

When calling bar, a first frame is created containing bar's arguments and local variables. When bar calls foo, a second frame is created and pushed on top of the first one containing `foo's` arguments and local variables. When foo returns, the top frame element is popped out of the stack (leaving only bar's call frame). When bar returns, the stack is empty.

### Heap

Objects are allocated in a heap which is just a name to denote a large (mostly unstructured) region of memory.

### Queue

A JavaScript runtime uses a message queue, which is a list of messages to be processed. Each message has an associated function which gets called in order to handle the message

At some point during the event loop, the runtime starts handling the messages on the queue, starting with the oldest one. To do so, the message is removed from the queue and its corresponding function is called with the message as an input parameter. As always, calling a function creates a new stack frame for that function's use.

The processing of functions continues until the stack is once again empty. Then, the event loop will process the next message in the queue (if there is one).

## Event Loop

The event loop got its name because of how it's usually implemented, which usually resembles:

```js
while (queue.waitForMessage()) {
  queue.processNextMessage()
}
```

`queue.waitForMessage()` waits synchronously for a message to arrive (if one is not already available and waiting to be handled).

### "Run-to-completion"

Each message is processed completely before any other message is processed.

This offers some nice properties when reasoning about your program, including the fact that whenever a function runs, it cannot be pre-empted and will run entirely before any other code runs (and can modify data the function manipulates). This differs from C, for instance, where if a function runs in a thread, it may be stopped at any point by the runtime system to run some other code in another thread.

A downside of this model is that if a message takes too long to complete, the web application is unable to process user interactions like click or scroll. The browser mitigates this with the "a script is taking too long to run" dialog. A good practice to follow is to make message processing short and if possible cut down one message into several messages.

### Adding messages

In web browsers, messages are added anytime an event occurs and there is an event listener attached to it. If there is no listener, the event is lost. So a click on an element with a click event handler will add a messageâ€”likewise with any other event.

# Timing Events - Timers

The two key methods to use with JavaScript are:

```js
//The setTimeout() and setInterval() are both methods of the HTML DOM Window object.

setTimeout(function, milliseconds)
//Executes a function, after waiting a specified number of milliseconds.

setInterval(function, milliseconds)
//Same as setTimeout(), but repeats the execution of the function continuously.
```

## The `setTimeout()` Method

`window.setTimeout(function, milliseconds);`

The method can be written without the window prefix.

The first parameter is a function to be executed.

The second parameter indicates the number of milliseconds before execution.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>Click "Try it". Wait 3 seconds, and the page will alert "Hello".</p>

<button onclick="setTimeout(myFunction, 3000);">Try it</button>

<script>
function myFunction() {
  alert('Hello');
}
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

How to Stop the Execution?

The `clearTimeout()` method stops the execution of the function specified in `setTimeout()`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>Click "Try it". Wait 3 seconds. The page will alert "Hello".</p>
<p>Click "Stop" to prevent the first function to execute.</p>
<p>(You must click "Stop" before the 3 seconds are up.)</p>

<button onclick="myVar = setTimeout(myFunction, 3000)">Try it</button>

<button onclick="clearTimeout(myVar)">Stop it</button>

<script>
function myFunction() {
  alert("Hello");
}
</script>
</body>
</html>
```
# The `setInterval()` Method

`window.setInterval(function, milliseconds);`

The `window.setInterval()` method can be written without the window prefix.

The first parameter is the function to be executed.

The second parameter indicates the length of the time-interval between each execution.

This example executes a function called "myTimer" once every second (like a digital watch).

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>A script on this page starts this clock:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var myVar = setInterval(myTimer, 1000);

function myTimer() {
  var d = new Date();
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = d.toLocaleTimeString();
}
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

How to Stop the Execution?

The `clearInterval()` method stops the executions of the function specified in the `setInterval()` method.

The `clearInterval()` method uses the variable returned from setInterval():

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>A script on this page starts this clock:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<button onclick="clearInterval(myVar)">Stop time</button>

<script>
var myVar = setInterval(myTimer ,1000);
function myTimer() {
  var d = new Date();
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = d.toLocaleTimeString();
}
</script>

</body>
</html>
```
